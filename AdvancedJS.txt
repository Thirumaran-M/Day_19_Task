Advance Javascript
callback,promise,fetch,async and await..
Small Application..

Callback?
diff between sync vs async..
Synchronous/Sequential:
Step By Step

Asynchronous->Parallel -> TimeConsuming Operation
InBuilt Async Function
setTimeout(()=>{},time in milliseconds)
Settimeout is an Inbuilt Async Function
it has 2 parameters
1.A Function
2. milliseconds
This function is used to perform certain task such
that after a couple of minutes it has to be displayed..

call stack,web api,callbackqueue


Call Stack:
it is called as Ledger,,
it is used to keep the track of the functions that are to be executed..
// Time consuming Operations..
console.log("App is starting!!!");
setTimeout(()=>console.log("Hello world!!"),3000)
console.log("App is deployed...")
setTimeout(()=>console.log("App is under testing!!!"),2000)
var sayhello = () =>{
    sayHi()
    console.log("Say Hello!!");
}
var sayHi = () =>{
    console.log("Say Bye!!!")
}

sayhello()

Web API:
it is the place where the actual Time Consuming Operations are executed!!!!


Event Queue:
It  the place where the async code waits for the execution!!!!
it is executed in the order as they placed in the event queue


Event Loop:
It is in between call stack and call back queue..
the main purpose is to check whether the call stack is empty 
or not
if it is empty, then the functions from the event queue will  be  pushed to
call stack  for the execution


console.log("App is under development")
setTimeout(function bar() {
    console.log("App is under staging");
}, 5000);
setTimeout(function foo() {
console.log('App is under construction!!');    
}, 2000);
console.log("App is under testing!");


console.log("App is under production!!!");
